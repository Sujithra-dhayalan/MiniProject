## SepsiPredict: An Early Prediction of Sepsis using Machine Learning Model
SepsiPredict focuses on developing a machine learning model for early sepsis detection using patient data, aiming to predict the onset of sepsis with high accuracy. By employing models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, the system assists healthcare professionals in making timely interventions to improve patient outcomes.

## About
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's extreme response to infection, often resulting in organ failure, tissue damage, and death. Early detection of sepsis is critical for timely intervention, reducing complications, and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we aim to develop an accurate and efficient machine learning-based sepsis prediction model using clinical datasets. By analyzing patient data such as vital signs, laboratory values, and demographic information, we employ various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of sepsis. Models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting sepsis. The dataset used in this study includes real-world patient records, and the models are optimized to handle class imbalance and improve prediction accuracy. Our goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool to aid in the early detection of sepsis, allowing for prompt intervention and improved patient care outcomes.

## Requirements

* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Google Colab

## Results and Impact
In this project, our experiments indicate that early detection of sepsis based on patient data can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. We are using a combination of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, along with data preprocessing techniques for predicting the likelihood of sepsis in patients. By leveraging these algorithms, healthcare professionals can receive accurate predictions in real-time, allowing for faster diagnosis and treatment.

Our approach ensures that medical teams can promptly identify sepsis, improving the chances of early intervention and reducing the risks associated with delayed diagnosis.
